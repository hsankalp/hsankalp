### Hi, I'm Sankalp ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software developer with experience developing User Interactive Web applications as well as Microservice based applications.
In addition to my work experience, I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Simulation Platform for Ford Autonomous Vehicles that provides the ability for any team in the AV space to rapidly emulate real-world trip scenarios in their own applications. The simulation service is being built using serverless architecture with the help of AWS Lambda functions and Java. The user facing web application that allows users to emulate the scenarios is being built using Reactjs and Material UI.
